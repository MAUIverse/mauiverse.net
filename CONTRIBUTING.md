# Contributing to mauiverse.net

Most contributions start with one of these goals:

- Run the website locally
- Add a new author
- Add a new community feed item
- Update an existing author or feed item

Use the contributor guide:

- [docs/contributing/README.md](./docs/contributing/README.md)

## Pull request flow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your content or author updates.
3. Run `npm run dev` and verify your change renders correctly.
4. Commit with a clear message describing the user-facing change.
5. Open a PR with a short summary and file list.

Keep `gitHubUsername` stable for existing authors unless you are intentionally doing a migration.
