This episode (from the Xamarin Podcast era) features Dean Ellis and Dominique Louis talking **MonoGame**: what it is, how it fits into C# game development, and what it takes to target multiple platforms.

If you’re curious about the roots of cross-platform C# app/game development—and how those ideas evolved into today’s .NET ecosystem—this is a fun listen.
