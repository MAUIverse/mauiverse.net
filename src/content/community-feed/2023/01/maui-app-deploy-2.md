Part 2 of Matt Goldman’s deployment series focuses on the **Apple ecosystem**: certificates, provisioning profiles, App Store Connect, and getting a .NET MAUI app into TestFlight and ultimately the App Store.

If you’ve only ever deployed to Android (or only used simulators), this is a great end-to-end reference for the iOS release pipeline.
