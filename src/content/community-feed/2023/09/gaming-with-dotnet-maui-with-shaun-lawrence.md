This session answers a common question directly: yes, you can build games with .NET MAUI.

Using real examples from Shaun’s game-building work, the talk breaks down how gameplay features are composed, how MAUI supports cross-platform iteration, and what engineering choices make the project easier to evolve.

### What you'll learn

- How to approach **game feature development** inside a MAUI application
- Design patterns for interactive UI, state transitions, and gameplay flow
- Implementation lessons from building a sliding puzzle game in .NET MAUI
- Ways to keep performance and maintainability in balance as scope grows

### Why watch this

- Focuses on practical engineering trade-offs, not just theory
- Gives reusable patterns for MAUI developers exploring interactive apps
- Helps you map game concepts into concrete .NET implementation steps

Watch the full video to see how these techniques come together in a real MAUI game development journey.
