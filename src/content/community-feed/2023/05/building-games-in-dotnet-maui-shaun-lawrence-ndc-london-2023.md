Curious whether .NET MAUI can support game development workflows? This session gives you a grounded, practical look.

Shaun demonstrates how to think about game structure in MAUI, how Orbit fits into the toolchain, and how to turn an idea into a maintainable cross-platform game project.

### What you'll learn

- The fundamentals of building games with **.NET MAUI + Orbit**
- How to structure project layers for reusable game logic and platform UI
- Key technical decisions for rendering flow, input, and iteration speed
- Patterns that help MAUI developers transition into game-oriented codebases

### Why watch this

- Great entry point if you’re MAUI-first and game-curious
- Emphasizes architecture and workflow, not just one-off demos
- Helps you start with clear technical guardrails and faster experimentation

Watch the full talk to see how Shaun turns MAUI game ideas into a concrete build strategy you can adapt.
