The .NET MAUI Community Toolkit is a collection of common elements for development with .NET MAUI that developers tend to replicate across multiple apps. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks when building apps with .NET MAUI.

All features are contributed by you, our amazing .NET community, and maintained by a core set of maintainers.

And – the best part – the features you add to the .NET MAUI Toolkit may one day be included into the official .NET MAUI library! We leverage the Community Toolkits to debut new features and work closely with the .NET MAUI engineering team to nominate features for promotion.
