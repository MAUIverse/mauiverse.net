This is a practical build focused on combining AI capabilities with a polished .NET MAUI user experience.

Hector walks through the full pipeline from prompt refinement to generated video output, including configuration handling and cross-platform playback behavior.

### What you'll learn

- How to implement a **prompt-to-video flow** in a MAUI app
- Using **XAML + MVVM** to keep AI features maintainable
- Adding **Azure OpenAI-based prompt enhancement** before generation
- Managing secure app settings and validating output behavior across platforms

### Why watch this

- Great reference for integrating generative AI in real app workflows
- Balances architecture guidance with concrete implementation details
- Includes code resources you can build on for your own experiments

Watch the full video to see how the complete AI video generation workflow is assembled and tested in .NET MAUI.
