Part 3 of Matt Goldman’s Batmobile UI series dives into the “why does the needle point there?” problem: translating RPM values into endpoint coordinates for a gauge pointer.

It’s an approachable walkthrough of the trigonometry (SOHCAHTOA, degrees vs radians, and coordinate offsets) used to compute `endX`/`endY` for a custom-drawn dial.
