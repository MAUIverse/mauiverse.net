Syncfusion’s Volume 2 preview calls out two new controls aimed at common UI pain points: **Color Picker** and **DockLayout**.

It also outlines improvements across existing components—especially DataGrid (row templates, clipboard, state serialization), plus Kanban workflow upgrades, PDF Viewer stamps, looping pickers, and TreeView drag-and-drop reordering.
