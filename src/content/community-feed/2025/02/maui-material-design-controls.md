Agustin takes a closer look at Maui.MaterialDesignControls, Horus Studios open-source UI toolkit designed to help .NET MAUI teams ship polished, consistent interfaces without reinventing common UI patterns. 

The post walks through the motivation behind the library, its evolution from a Xamarin-era plugin, and why the team invested in modernising it for real production apps rather than treating it as a simple control pack.

You’ll get a practical feel for how the library reduces everyday UI friction, especially in forms and authentication flows where boilerplate can quickly pile up. The article contrasts “raw MAUI” implementations with the Material controls side by side, showing how the toolkit can shrink verbose layouts into more maintainable, intention-revealing markup. There’s also useful context around the library’s new .NET 10 support, what that means for long-term stability, and how the project is being maintained in the open.

If you’re weighing whether to standardise your app’s look and feel. . . or just want to spend less time rebuilding the same UI scaffolding. . . this is a worthwhile deep dive.
