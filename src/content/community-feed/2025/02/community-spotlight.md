.NET MAUI Day brought the community together for talks, demos, and networking. Here are a few highlights:

- **Sessions** covered everything from getting started to advanced patterns.
- **Open source** maintainers shared their latest work and roadmaps.
- **Celebrations** — we raised a virtual glass to another year of cross-platform .NET.

Thanks to everyone who participated. See you next time, and keep building with MAUI.
