Syncfusion announced the third set of open-source controls for the **Syncfusion Toolkit for .NET MAUI**.

This drop adds UI primitives like **Accordion**, **Cards**, **Expander**, **Popup**, and **OTP Input**, and it also emphasizes platform-level improvements: Toolkit-wide support for **trimming** and **native AOT**, plus general fixes and stability updates.
