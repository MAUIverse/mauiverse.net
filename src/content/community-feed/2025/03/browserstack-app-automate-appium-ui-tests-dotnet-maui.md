This post walks through taking existing **Appium UI tests** for a .NET MAUI app and running them on **BrowserStack App Automate** (real devices in the cloud).

It covers the needed config files, how to wire credentials securely in CI, and includes a GitHub Actions workflow example to automate test runs for Android and iOS.
