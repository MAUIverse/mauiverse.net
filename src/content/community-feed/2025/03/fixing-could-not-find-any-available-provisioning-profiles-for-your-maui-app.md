Setting up a new Mac for .NET MAUI iOS development should be straightforward, yet sometimes the final build and deploy step refuses to cooperate. This post walks through a realistic end to end setup scenario and highlights a common stumbling point that can appear even when everything seems correctly installed and configured.

Rather than stopping at the error message, the author methodically investigates what is happening under the hood and demonstrates a practical fix that restores a smooth build experience. The write-up is concise, reproducible, and especially useful for anyone bringing up a fresh MAUI environment or troubleshooting unexpected iOS deployment failures.

If your clean setup has ever felt anything but clean, this quick guide is worth a look.
