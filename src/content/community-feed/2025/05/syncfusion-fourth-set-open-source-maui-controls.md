Syncfusion published the fourth batch of open-source controls for the **Syncfusion Toolkit for .NET MAUI**.

This release focuses on core “building block” UI: **Picker**, **Date Picker**, **DateTime Picker**, **Time Picker**, plus **Circular** and **Linear Progress Bar** controls—along with general improvements and bug fixes across the Toolkit.
