NDC posted a great conference talk from **Anjuli Jhakry** that’s squarely in the MAUIverse: a tour of cross-platform development with **.NET MAUI**, with lessons learned from real-world app building.

If you’re evaluating MAUI, onboarding a team, or just want a solid “why/when/how” talk to share, this is an easy recommend.
