In this forward-looking post, Juan from Horus Studio explores what .NET 10 means for teams building with .NET MAUI, focusing on the practical changes that will shape day-to-day development. Rather than treating the release as a simple version bump, the article walks through the performance improvements, API shifts, and deprecations that developers should be aware of before planning their next upgrade.

You’ll get a guided tour of key updates like global XAML namespaces, implicit namespace support, and the new XAML source generation pipeline — along with why these changes matter for cleaner projects and faster UI rendering. The post also calls out important platform shifts, including the move away from ListView and MessagingCenter, expanded safe area handling, and the growing push toward async-first APIs. It’s particularly useful if you maintain existing MAUI apps and want to understand where friction might appear during migration.

If .NET 10 is on your roadmap (or should be), this is a solid technical briefing to help you prepare with eyes open.
