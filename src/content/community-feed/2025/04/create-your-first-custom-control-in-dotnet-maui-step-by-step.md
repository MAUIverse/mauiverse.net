Custom controls are one of the fastest ways to improve consistency and reuse across a MAUI app.

In this tutorial, Hector breaks down the building blocks of a first control and explains how bindable APIs and MVVM make the component clean to consume from multiple pages.

### What you'll learn

- How to design a first **custom control** in .NET MAUI
- Applying **Bindable Properties** for configurable, reusable behavior
- Structuring controls so they fit naturally into an **MVVM** codebase
- A practical component mindset you can apply to progress/status UI patterns

### Why watch this

- Helps you move from page-level UI to reusable component architecture
- Clarifies a topic that often feels abstract in docs alone
- Gives implementation patterns you can reuse immediately

Watch the full video to build the control step by step and adapt the pattern to your own app’s component library.
