This is a fun and technical example of stretching .NET MAUI into interactive event experiences.

Tony explores how MIDI devices, real-world datasets, and app logic can connect to power game-show style interactions, with MAUI handling the cross-platform UX layer and the flow of live input.

### What you'll learn

- How to integrate **MIDI controller signals** into a MAUI-driven interaction model
- Ways to transform external data (like bird-song datasets) into gameplay mechanics
- Architectural ideas for event-based apps with audience participation
- Practical patterns for coordinating input, state changes, and responsive visuals

### Why watch this

- Shows MAUI in a creative, non-traditional technical use case
- Blends hardware, data, and UX engineering in one cohesive project
- Offers ideas you can adapt for demos, installations, or interactive products

Watch the full talk to see how these components come together into a playful but technically robust MAUI experience.
