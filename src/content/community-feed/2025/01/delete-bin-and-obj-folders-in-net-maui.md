We've all been there. Something's not building right, your app icon won't update, and someone inevitably says "did you try deleting bin and obj?" Victor created a VS Code extension that turns this ritual into a single right-click.

No more hunting through nested folders across iOS, Android, and Windows projects. Just right-click, select "Delete /bin and /obj Folders," and boom—clean slate. It's one of those small quality-of-life improvements that saves you minutes every day (and we all know those minutes add up).

**What you get:**
- One-click cleanup for all bin/obj folders in your MAUI projects
- Works recursively across all platforms and nested projects
- Simple VS Code context menu integration
- More time coding, less time folder hunting

[Check out Victor's post](https://dev.to/vhugogarcia/delete-bin-and-obj-folders-in-net-maui-3j1e) and grab the extension from the VS Code marketplace!
