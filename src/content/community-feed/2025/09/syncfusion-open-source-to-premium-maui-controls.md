Syncfusion broke down the “two-lane” story for MAUI UI: a free, open-source Toolkit for essentials, and a premium suite for larger enterprise needs.

The post highlights what’s new in the Toolkit (e.g., charts and quality-of-life upgrades) and contrasts that with the premium offering: high-performance controls like **DataGrid**, **PDF Viewer**, **Scheduler**, plus a broader **95+ control** set and document libraries for PDF/Word/Excel/PowerPoint workloads.
