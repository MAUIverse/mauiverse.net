If you’ve ever tried to build a **reorderable grid** in .NET MAUI and thought “surely there’s a built-in way to do this”… you’re not alone.

In this post, **Jean-Marie Alfonsi** introduces **`Sharpnado.Maui.DragDropGridView`**—a grid layout that supports drag-and-drop reordering (with LongPress or Pan), animations, header support, and auto-scrolling when you drag near the edges.

It’s also a great deep dive into the practical platform quirks you run into with gestures and ZIndex, and how the library works around them.
