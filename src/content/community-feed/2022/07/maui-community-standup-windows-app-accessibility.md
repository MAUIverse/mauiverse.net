This standup revisits accessibility with a Windows lens—useful if your MAUI app targets desktop scenarios and you want to ensure keyboard, screen reader, and UX fundamentals are solid.

A good reminder that accessibility work is both platform-specific and end-to-end: UI, semantics, and testing all matter.
