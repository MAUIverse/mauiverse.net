If you want to understand how far you can push .NET MAUI beyond line-of-business apps, this talk is a great deep dive.

Shaun walks through his real-world experience building game engine capabilities with MAUI, including trade-offs, framework choices, and what to prioritize first when shaping a playable architecture.

### What you'll learn

- How a **.NET MAUI-first approach** can support early game engine experiments
- Which core engine concerns (rendering flow, input handling, update loops) matter most at the start
- How to evaluate MAUI strengths and constraints when designing game-focused systems
- Practical decision points that help you keep momentum instead of over-designing

### Why watch this

- Connects conceptual engine design with implementation choices you can apply quickly
- Gives a realistic view of building game features in a cross-platform .NET stack
- Helps you decide when MAUI is the right fit for your next game prototype

Watch the full session to follow Shaun’s architecture choices and use them as a blueprint for your own MAUI game experiments.
