.NET 9 is here and it's bringing some seriously good stuff to .NET MAUI! Yeah, it's an STS release, but Victor makes a great case for why that's totally fine for mobile apps. We're already shipping updates all the time anyway, right?

The improvements are legit: better performance across the board, the new HybridWebView control for blending web and native content, and a bunch of polish on existing controls like CollectionView and CarouselView. Plus, if you're building for Windows, you get the new TitleBar customization options.

**Highlights:**
- Enhanced performance and stability improvements
- New HybridWebView control for hybrid scenarios
- CollectionView and CarouselView performance boosts
- Better button rendering on iOS with accurate spacing
- Most .NET 6+ packages work without issues
