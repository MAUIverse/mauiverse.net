This NDC London session takes a decision-driven approach to software development, where each technical choice leads to different outcomes.

Shaun frames the talk as a “choose your own adventure,” helping developers think through architecture, tooling, and implementation paths in a way that maps well to real cross-platform project planning.

### What you'll learn

- How to evaluate **engineering trade-offs** when multiple valid options exist
- Ways to choose implementation paths based on maintainability, speed, and team constraints
- Practical thinking patterns for guiding app architecture as requirements change
- How scenario-based decision making improves execution in real projects

### Why watch this

- Strong fit for developers who want clearer decision frameworks, not just code snippets
- Helps you reason through technical direction before committing to implementation
- Offers a reusable approach you can apply to MAUI and broader .NET project work

Watch the full talk to follow Shaun’s decision paths and apply the same style of technical thinking to your next build.
