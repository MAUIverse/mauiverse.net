Sometimes you want a UI that goes beyond what platform-native controls can easily deliver. Javier shows **DrawnUi.Maui**, which uses **SkiaSharp** to render “drawn” controls in a MAUI app.

This is a useful watch if you’re exploring high-customization UI (unique visuals, animations, or consistent rendering) while still working inside a MAUI project.
