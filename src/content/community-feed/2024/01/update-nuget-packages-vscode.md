Managing NuGet packages in VS Code for MAUI projects? Victor's got a sweet workflow using the `dotnet-outdated` tool that makes it super simple. Run one command, see what's outdated (with color coding!), update your .csproj, and you're done.

No heavy IDE needed. The tool even breaks down packages by platform so you can see exactly which iOS, Android, or Windows packages need updating. It's lightweight, fast, and honestly kind of addictive once you get used to it.

**You'll learn:**
- Using dotnet-outdated to find outdated packages
- Understanding color-coded version updates (red/yellow/green)
- Updating .csproj files manually
- Why this beats waiting for VS Code NuGet extensions

[Check out Victor's guide](https://dev.to/vhugogarcia/net-maui-update-nuget-packages-using-visual-studio-code-32al) and keep your packages fresh!
