Sometimes the best way to level up your UI skills is to take a real design and rebuild it end-to-end.

In this post, **Leomaris Reyes** walks through recreating a **Valentine-inspired login + registration UI** in .NET MAUI, breaking the screen into digestible layout blocks and building it up step by step.

- It’s beginner-friendly (no “magic styles” required to follow along)
- It reinforces **layout thinking** (structure first, polish second)
- You’ll end up with patterns you can reuse for any form-style UI
