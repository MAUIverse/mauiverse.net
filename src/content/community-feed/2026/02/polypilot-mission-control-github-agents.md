n this video, Gerald Versluis sits down with Shane to explore PolyPilot, Shane’s ambitious project for orchestrating multiple AI coding agents from a single control surface. Built with .NET MAUI and Blazor, PolyPilot provides a cross-platform dashboard where you can spin up, coordinate, and monitor parallel Copilot agents working across different repositories and models.

The walkthrough covers how PolyPilot manages concurrent agent workflows, isolates work through worktrees, and enables remote monitoring from your phone using DevTunnel. Shane explains the thinking behind features like squad presets, reflection cycles, and session persistence, while Gerald helps surface the practical developer scenarios this unlocks. It is an interesting look at where AI-assisted development tooling may be heading, especially for teams experimenting with multi-agent automation.

If you are curious about advanced Copilot workflows or pushing .NET MAUI beyond traditional app scenarios, this conversation is well worth your time.
