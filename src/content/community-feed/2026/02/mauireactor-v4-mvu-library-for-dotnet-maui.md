MauiReactor v4 marks a major milestone for one of the most established MVU options in the .NET MAUI ecosystem.

After a long journey from Xamarin.Forms to modern .NET MAUI, this release focuses on helping developers stay in pure C# while keeping UI code declarative, state-driven, and easy to iterate on.

### Check out the repo to learn

- How MauiReactor applies the **MVU (Model-View-Update)** pattern on top of .NET MAUI.
- Why component-based, pure C# UI can feel familiar to teams coming from React or Flutter-style workflows.
- What changes in v4 matter most for day-to-day development, including the move to **.NET 10** targets.

If you're exploring alternatives to classic MVVM in MAUI, this repo is a strong reference point and a practical way to compare development ergonomics in a real project.
