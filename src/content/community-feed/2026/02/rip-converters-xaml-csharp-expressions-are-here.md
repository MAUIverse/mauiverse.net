Converters have always been one of those “necessary… until they aren’t” parts of XAML UI work.

In this video, **Gerald Versluis** covers using **C# expressions in XAML**, and how that can simplify common binding transforms and UI glue code.

### Why it’s worth a watch

- Fewer one-off converters to maintain
- More readable “what does this binding do?” logic inline with the XAML
- A nice companion topic to the broader push toward more compile-time-friendly patterns in MAUI/XAML
