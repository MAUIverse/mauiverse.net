If Shell navigation has ever felt too “automatic” for your app, this session helps you take control.

Hector walks through route design and menu customization patterns that make complex .NET MAUI apps easier to reason about, especially when multiple features and navigation paths start to overlap.

### What you'll learn

- How to define and reason about **manual Shell routes** instead of relying on defaults
- Why **hierarchical paths** improve navigation clarity in growing apps
- Ways to add and style **custom flyout menu items** for better UX
- Practical guidance on using `Shell.Current.GoToAsync` without creating fragile flows

### Why watch this

- Great fit if your app navigation is getting hard to maintain
- Gives a concrete architecture mindset you can apply right away
- Helps you avoid route design mistakes before they become expensive

Watch the full video to see each concept applied step by step in a real .NET MAUI scenario.
