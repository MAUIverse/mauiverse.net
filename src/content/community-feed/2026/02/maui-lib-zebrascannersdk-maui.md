This post explains the motivation behind `ZebraScannerSDK.Maui`, created when migrating Xamarin apps to .NET MAUI while Zebra’s MAUI package was still evolving and less convenient to consume as a normal NuGet dependency.

Johan summarizes what the library adds over earlier approaches, including a streamlined NuGet experience, `AddZebraScannerSDK` service registration, an injectable `IScannerSDK` interface, and a sample project alongside links to official Zebra resources for deeper implementation details.
