If you’re looking for a real-world .NET MAUI project to study, `AlohaAI` is worth a close look. Jakub Florkowski combines learning content, quiz flows, and progress systems into a clean cross-platform app that feels production-minded while still being approachable.

Highlights from the repository:

- Built with **.NET 10 + MAUI** using an **MVVM** architecture.
- Ships with **132 lessons**, **35 quizzes**, and **8 learning paths** focused on AI/ML topics.
- Uses an **offline-first** model with embedded content, so the app can run without an internet connection.
- Includes practical product touches like streak tracking, achievements, search, and profile progress.

The codebase is a strong reference for structuring content-heavy MAUI applications, especially if you want to blend education-style UX with maintainable app architecture. Explore the repo for implementation ideas, run it locally, and borrow patterns for your next MAUI build.
