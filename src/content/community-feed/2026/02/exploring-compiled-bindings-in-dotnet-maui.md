Bindings are one of the best parts of XAML—but string-based paths and runtime resolution can hide problems until your app is already running (or worse: in users’ hands).

This Telerik post by **Leomaris Reyes** is a practical walkthrough of **compiled bindings** in .NET MAUI: what they are, what problems they solve, and how the newer APIs help you get more compile-time validation.

### Highlights

- **Earlier error detection** (catch broken bindings at build time instead of runtime)
- **Less reflection overhead** in common scenarios
- A clear look at **newer binding APIs** that move you away from stringly-typed paths
