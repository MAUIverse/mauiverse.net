Building a MAUI app for TV form factors means you need a first-class story for **remote control navigation**: D-Pad directions, OK/Select, Back/Menu, and predictable focus movement.

**Plugin.Maui.TvDPad** (by **Hubert Graham**) provides that missing glue:

- Directional key support (Up/Down/Left/Right)
- OK/Select (Enter) + navigation buttons (Back/Menu)
- Focus navigation between UI elements
- Event-driven API (`KeyDown`, `KeyUp`, `FocusNavigationRequested`)

If you’re experimenting with Android TV layouts, this is a great reference implementation.
