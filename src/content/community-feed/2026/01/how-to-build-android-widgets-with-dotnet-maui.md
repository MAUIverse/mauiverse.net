Android widgets can live “inside” your MAUI app, but they still have their own rules: `RemoteViews`, `AppWidgetProvider`, intent-based interactions, and OEM quirks.

This guest post from **Toine de Boer** is a great reference if you want to build a widget that starts simple (static) and grows into something interactive and configurable.

Bonus: the post links to a working sample repo (`Maui.WidgetExample`) so you can copy/paste from something real.
