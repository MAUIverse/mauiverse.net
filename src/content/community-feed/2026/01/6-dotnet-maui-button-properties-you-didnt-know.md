Buttons are “simple” until you need them to look and behave exactly right across platforms and accessibility settings.

In this Telerik post, **Leomaris Reyes** walks through six handy Button properties that are easy to miss but make a big difference when you’re refining UI details.

### Quick hits

- `TextTransform` for consistent casing
- `FontAutoScalingEnabled` to respect (or intentionally ignore) system font scaling
- `CharacterSpacing`, `CornerRadius`, `FontFamily`, and `LineBreakMode` for tighter visual control
